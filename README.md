# Benjamin Crozat's blog

This is the source code for my revenue-generating 20K monthly visitors [blog](https://carlossantosdev.com). It's **100% not vibe coded** BTW.

**Feel free to steal whatever you need.** But first, why don't you follow me on [X](https://x.com/carlossantosdev)?

## What to expect

- **Independently built and maintained:**  
  This codebase evolves organically as time allows and needs arise.
  
- **Production-ready Laravel code:**  
  Explore clean, fast, and scalable code with Actions, Jobs, Policies, and more, as well as a thoughtfully organized structure.

- **Monetization & analytics:**  
  See how I implemented affiliate links, ad-blocker-resistant analytics, and outbound tracking for real revenue.

- **Beautiful admin (WIP) & user experience:**  
  Discover how Filament v4 powers my admin panel and how Livewire brings interactivity to my custom-made comments system and forms.

- **Automation & background jobs:**  
  See how I automate content, recommendations, and more using AI, queues (managed by Horizon), and scheduled tasks.

- **Cloudflare Images integration:**  
  Because I didn't want to develop my own image upload flow from scratch.

- **Comprehensive test suite:**  
  130+ tests written using Pest show how to keep features reliable and code maintainable.
